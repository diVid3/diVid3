# Rest here traveler, you've seen too many github repositories

### In the meantime, let me introduce myself

- 👋 Hi, I’m Evert
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about theodolites
- 💞️ I’m allergic to dogs :< but I have the best doggo

I have some things laying around here though github is not my only hosting provider. Once rested, feel free to poke around.

<!---
diVid3/diVid3 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
